	<h2 class="it"> Oldest Gelato Shop in Utah</h2>
	<p class="so"> Dolcetti was started in 2004 as three Italian ice carts around Salt lake City. Since then, we've set up shop at 9th and 9th in Salt Lake City- serving macroons, espresso, tea, espresso, and our 150 rotating unique artisan gelato flavors.</p>
	 
	<h2 class="it"> Everything is Made from Scratch</h2>
	<p class="so"> And we're obsessed with the cool stuff we get. Everything we put in out gelato has the integrity of its original flavor, wether it be fruit or nots, milk, oils, or even fresh honeycomb candy. And, as we still need variety in out life, Oreos and Reese's. </p>
	
	<h2 class="it"> We Really Like Our Customers</h2>
	<p class="so"> Our favorite moments and happiest moments is when guests tell us our gelato is like nothing they have never had. Some say it reminds them of Italy, or its the best ice cream ever, or they love this flavor more than the last flavor. And sometimes we run out of Coconut Sticky Rice, the AC breaks, or the phone mysteriously finds itself in the sink. You guys are so nicest about. We're honored that our treats get to be the fun fun part of the day.</p>
